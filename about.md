Hi,

I am a software engineer at Cisco currently working on building solutions that simplify the Video Content Metadata Management across multiple geographies for service providers. My work is centered around building microservices for the video content metadata management.I believe that simplicity is the purest form of knowledge. This is my attempt to simplify the whole computer technology space. This blog concentrates on the latest trends in topics ranging from programming, compute, algorithms, security,machine learning, CICD, hardware,distributed systems to almost anything related to the computing world.
