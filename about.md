Hi,

I am a software development engineer at TESCO currently building the Enterprise Customer Order with a vision to have a omnibasket for all TESCO channels including grocery,general merchandise, mobile, wine, store and almost all orders that TESCO takes. I am responsible for 3DR[ Designing, Developing, Deploying and Running] Enterprise Customer Order for TESCO. 
 
Previously I was working with CISCO as a Product Owner/Technical Lead,building solutions that simplify the Video Content Metadata Management across multiple geographies for service providers. My work primarily included building microservices for the video content metadata management.

I believe that simplicity is the purest form of knowledge. This is my attempt to simplify the whole computer technology space. This blog concentrates on the latest trends in topics ranging from programming, compute, algorithms, security,machine learning, CICD, hardware,distributed systems to almost anything related to the computing world.
