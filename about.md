Hi,

I am working as an Architect at TESCO currently building the New Retail Platform[Customer order service and order fulfilment service] with a vision to give our customers a omni channel experience across all TESCO channels including grocery, general merchandise, mobile, wine, store and almost all orders that TESCO takes. I am responsible for 3DR[ Designing, Developing, Deploying and Running] this platform for TESCO.

 Previously I lead the architecture, design and development of the new omni channel customer order Transactional API platform from scratch which is currently handling all Tesco order transactions, returns and refunds [online apps & website,retail stores, scan-pay-go, Pick and GO, Whoosh delivery] , order search and order archival of roughly ~5 billion orders.

 Now I am currently leading the architecture, design and development of Order Fulfilment service. The order fulfilment service provides multiple delivery propositions to customers based on contextual information [including custimerId, customer category, delivery location, picking capacity etc]. It manages stock reservation, picking capacity reservation , delivery slot reservation and order amend/cancel feasibility during the precheckout. Post checkout the service orchestrates Picking [retail stores, Automated robotic picking , third party seller ] and transportation tracking [third party delivery services and in house tesco delivery]

Before that I was working with CISCO as a Technical Lead, building solutions that simplify the Video Content Metadata Management across multiple geographies for service providers. My work primarily included building and designing cloud native architectures for the video content metadata management.

I believe that simplicity is the purest form of knowledge. This is my attempt to simplify the whole computer technology space. This blog concentrates on the latest trends in topics ranging from programming, compute, algorithms, security,machine learning, CICD, hardware,distributed systems to almost anything related to the computing world.
