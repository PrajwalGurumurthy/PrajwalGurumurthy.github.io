title: Completely Distributed Peer-Peer Load sharing
---

>The Problem statement

Lets define the problem first.We have 'n' resources R1,R2,R3....Rn which can be any of 'k' type RT1,RT2,RT3...RTk which arrives as a stream of events. The stream of events are the CRUD operation on these resources. Each of the events are idempotent and self contained. They carry all the information needed to get processsed. The problem is to build a completely distributed peer-peer load sharing system among the processing nodes.

<b>Challenges</b>

{% highlight text %}

    The resources can arrive in anyorder of any type.
    The same resource can arrive one after the other in the queue.
    The final update of the resource has to be persistent.
    

{% endhighlight %}

Note that the processing nodes are all running and pulling events from the queue parallelly.
