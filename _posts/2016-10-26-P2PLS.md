>The Problem statement

Lets define the problem first.We have a 'n'resources R1,R2,R3....Rn which can be any of 'k' type RT1,RT2,RT3...RTk which can arrive as a stream of events. The events can be CRUD operation on these resources. Each of the events are idempotent and self contained. They carry all the information needed to get processsed. The problem is to build a completely distributed pper-peer load sharing among the processing nodes.
