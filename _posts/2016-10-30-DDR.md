title: Distributed Dependency Resolution
---

>The Problem statement

We have 'n' resources R1,R2,R3....Rn which can be any of 'k' type RT1,RT2,RT3...RTk which arrives as a stream of events. The stream of events are the CRUD operation on these resources. Each of the events are idempotent and self contained. They carry all the information needed to get processsed. Lets add a bit of spice. Lets say we have a dependency template that says the dependency relation amoing the resourcetypes.
