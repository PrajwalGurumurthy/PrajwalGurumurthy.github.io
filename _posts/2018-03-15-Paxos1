title: Paxos: Part 1
description: This post highlights the challenges in achieving consensus in a distributed environment. This post also covers safety and liveliness properties w.r.t distributed consensus.

  Why Paxos?
    distributed consensus
    Replicated Log state machine

  Single vs multi Paxos
  Proposers and acceptors

  Set the goals right before starting:
    Ground rules as long as the majority of nodes are available the system must reach consensus
    Safety and liveliness
    Assumptions about failure tolerance[failure of nodes ,delay in messages, lost messages but not Byzantine Failures]


Solutions:

  Single acceptor
  Quorum of acceptors

  Why we need multiple phases?
  2pc vs 3pc
  2 phase commit [Once a value is chosen future proposals must propose the same value]
  Check before proposing

  Fix 2pc problem by ordering the proposals


Paxos:
  Prepare-promise
  propose-accept

  Safe but not Lively?
